A game for Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy visit http://hh.yaseen.xyz to play the game



## Background
This game was originally coded in 3 days over the weekend for a language arts project.

It has since been overhauled and made feature-rich, complete with dynamically loaded fonts, high quality sprites (thanks to [ekobor](http://pixeljoint.com/p/23774.htm)!), and a high score meter to compete with friends!

It also features custom made game sounds that were created using [ChipTone](http://sfbgames.com/chiptone/) by Tom Vian.
